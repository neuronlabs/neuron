## What is Neuron-Core?

Neuron-core is a cloud-ready **Golang** ORM. It's design allows to
query multiple related models located on different datastores/repositories.

## Design

The neuron-core is golang ORM implementation designed to process microservice repositories. This concept enhanced the requirements for the models mapping and query processor.

The mapped models must have all the field's with [defined type](https://docs.neuronlabs.io/neuron-core/models/structure.html#model-structure). The initial model mapping was based on the [JSONAPI v1.0](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-objects) model definition. The distributed environment required each [relationship](https://docs.neuronlabs.io/neuron-core/models/relationship.html) to be specified of it's kind and type, just as their foreign keys.

The query processor needs to work as the orchestrator, choreographer. As each model's repository might use different database, it needs to implement distributed [transactions](https://docs.neuronlabs.io/neuron-core/query/transactions.html).

## Quick Start

* Define the models
```go
package models

// User is the model that is stored on the 'main' repository.
// It is related to multiple 'Pet' models.
type User struct {
    ID      int
    Name    string
    Surname string
    Pets []*Pet `neuron:"type=relation;foreign=OwnerID"`
}

// Pet is the model related with the User.
// It is stored in the 'secondary' repository.
type Pet struct {
    ID      int
    Name    string
    OwnerID int `neuron:"type=foreign"`
}

// RepositoryName implements RepositoryNamer interface.
func (p *Pet) RepositoryName() string {
    return "secondary"
}
```

* Import repositories and Create, Read or get Default `*config.Controller`
```go
package main

// blank imported repository registers it's factory
// and the driver.
import _ "github.com/neuronlabs/neuron-pq"

import (
    "github.com/neuronlabs/neuron-core"
    "github.com/neuronlabs/neuron-core/config"
)

func main() {
    cfg := config.ReadDefaultConfig()
    // By setting the LogLevel the default logger would be used.
    cfg.LogLevel = "debug"    
...    
```
* Create the `*controller.Controller` and register repositories.
```go
    // Provided create config 'cfg' to the Controller method.
    c := ncore.Controller(cfg)

    // As the 'neuron-core' allows to use multiple repository for the models
    // we can declare the DefaultRepository within the config. The first 
    // registered repository would be set as the default as well. 
    mainDB := &config.Repository{
        // Currently registered repository 'neuron-pq' has it's driver name: 'pq'.
        DriverName: "pq",        
        Host: "localhost",   
        Port: "5432",
        Username: "main_db_user",
        Password: "main_db_password",
        DBName: "main",
    }
    if err := c.RegisterRepository("main", mainDB); err != nil {
        // handle error
    }

    // We can register and use different repository for other models.
    secondaryDB := &config.Repository{        
        DriverName: "pq",        
        Host: "172.16.1.10",
        Port: "5432",
        Username: "secondary_user",
        Password: "secondary_password",
        DBName: "secondary",
    }

    // Register secondary repository.
    if err := c.RegisterRepository("secondary", secondaryDB); err != nil {
        // handle error
    }
```

* Register models 
```go
    if err := c.RegisterModels(models.User{}, models.Pet{}); err != nil {
        // handle error
    }
```

* Query registered models
```go
    users := []*User{}
    
    s := ncore.MustQueryC(c, &users)
    // the query scope may be filtered
    s.Filter("filter[users][name][$in]","John", "Sam")
    // it might also be sorted
    s.Sort("-id")
    
    // list all the users with the name 'John' or 'Sam' with 'id' ordered 
    // descending.
    if err = s.List(); err != nil {
        // resolve the error
    }
```

## Packages

The `neuron-core` is composed of the following packages:

* `query` - used to query the model's repositories.
* `controller` - is the neuron's core, that registers and stores the models and contains configurations required by other packages.
* `mapping` - contains the information about the mapped models their fields and settings
* `config` - contains the configurations structures.
* `class` - contains `github.com/neuronlabs/errors` class instances used by the neuron-core package.
* `repository` - is a package used to store, get and register the repositories nad their factories.
* `log` - is the logging interface for the neuron based applications.
* `i18n` - is the neuron based application supported internationalization
